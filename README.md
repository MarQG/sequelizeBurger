# sequelizeBurger
Eat Da Burger has now been updated to use Sequelize!

The same fun app that lets you add burgers and eat them is even better
with Sequelize.

## Adding a Burger
![Add a Burger](./md-img/burger1.jpg)

To Add a burger Simple fill in the form at the bottom. The great thing is
anyone can add a burger! Go on and add away to your burgery content!

## Eating a Burger
To eat a burger first you have to put in your name in the form at the top.
That way we know who really likes what ;). After you have put in your name
just hit the Devour It! Button next to the burger and enjoy the fact that
you have now taken away a burger from everyone else. (Aren't you special! :D)

## Cleaning Up a Burger
Of course with everyone eating so many burgers things can get a little messy
and we know how nice of a person you are right?! So just hit the Clean Up! Button
and watch as your mess ( or someone elses if you are extra nice ) is cleaned up
in a snap. With cleaning this easy you might even want to do the dishes more often!
